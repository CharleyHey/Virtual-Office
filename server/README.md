# Virtual Office

Virtual Office is a project developed by students to increase their skillset at programming languages in general and decision making processes in a demographic tool. It's supposed to be a test environment for possible employees which will be tailored to different kind of aspects concerning the criteria asked for.

This project will grow over time and is still in the beginning phase. The current code being used is mainly aquired through e-learning courses given by [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/StephenGrider).
